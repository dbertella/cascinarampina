This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## How to run the project locally

Set up `WORDPRESS_API_URL=` in your env file pointing to your wp server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Powered by Worppress

I'm using wordpress as an headless CMS using [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql) plugin, to have a graphql server instead of plain rest apis
